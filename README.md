This is basic Python code for crating Telegram bot.
Aiogram , Spotipy , OpenAI libraries heve been used in this code. 
This code can create Telegram bot with various functionalities, including sending photos, handling commands like /search, /image, /games, /video, /social, /message, and /movie, as well as storing user messages in an SQLite database. 

Note:
Use aiogram version 2.9 because new versions can not support this code.

to install neccecery libraries go command center or press "win"+r , type cmd and press enter.
And type these:

-pip install spotipy2
-pip install openai
-pip install aiogram==2.9

And also while searching music write music name after command.
Use this method while writing command "message".
